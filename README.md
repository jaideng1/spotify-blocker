# Spotify Blocker
A program to block songs on Spotify.


if you want to use it, it's not going to work cause i did not finish it really

you will need to create a file in `src` called codes.json, and also create an application from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications. 
From there, get those keys and in `codes.json`, you'll need to format it like this:
```
{
  "clientSecret": "<THE CLIENT SECRET>"
  "clientID": "<THE CLIENT ID>"
}
```

After, run `npm install` in CMD or Terminal inside the directory to install the packages.

Then to run it, run `npm test`.

i will eventally finish it, but i haven't had the time lately, so i'll do it sooner or later.  

sorry for any confusion!
